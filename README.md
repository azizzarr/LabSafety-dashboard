# Smart Workplace Safety & Compliance Platform

A modular and intelligent web application designed to enhance safety, compliance, and predictive maintenance within workplace environments such as labs, factories, and industrial sites. Originally focused on Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) monitoring, the platform now integrates broader safety functionalities powered by AI and real-time analytics.

## üöÄ Overview

This platform leverages predictive AI and modern web technologies to help organizations:

- Monitor ESD levels and PPE compliance in real time
- Predict the lifespan of insulating safety equipment (e.g., shoes)
- Track environmental and ergonomic risks
- Detect anomalies in employee behavior
- Automate safety reporting and regulatory audits
- Provide smart dashboards and safety scoring

Built on a microservices architecture, each feature is modular, scalable, and secured with token-based access and full traceability.
